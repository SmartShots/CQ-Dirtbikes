# What does the MOD actually do?
The MOD recognises when one of the above Conquest maps are loaded on the server and will then:

- Spawn 4 Dirtbikes at each teams deployment or near to it (see Notes) for levels that had no Dirtbikes previously.
- Spawn 1 to 2 Dirtbikes (depending on level/game mode size) at each teams deployment for levels that already had some Dirtbikes previously.

# Notes:
The Close Quarters Conquest Domnination maps are excluded, they are too small to have Dirtbikes running around.
Operation Metro Conquest Maps are excluded - the level is just not appropriate for having Dirtbikes on.
On the Noshahr Canals levels the US teams Dirtbikes are spawned at one of the flags near their deployment.
On the maps using Conquest Assault the Defending teams Dirtbikes are spawned at one of the flags further away from the attacking teams deployment.
